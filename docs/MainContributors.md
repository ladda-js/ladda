# Main Contributors
Many people are involved in Ladda in one way or another. Might be by just saying something giving us an idea, by ad-hoc feedback on Facebook or whathever. Thanks to all of you!

Some people and organizations that contributed a lot:
- [**Small Improvements**](https://www.small-improvements.com): The first user of Ladda and also allowed us to work on Ladda at work during our slack time! Being a place full of highly skilled developers, and being a feedback company, has resulted in plenty of constructive feedback for Ladda!

- [**Robin Wieruch**](https://github.com/rwieruch): Pushed Ladda from being "Peter friendly" to being "Human friendly" (or well, at least "Developer friendly"). Kicked off the work with docs and examples. Proposed new features and discussed existing.

- [**Gernot Höflechner**](https://github.com/LFDM/): Pushed Peter to work on Ladda. Kept bringing it up until it happened. Also involved in the [initial discussions](./Introduction.md#background) and discussions about the future of Ladda.

- [**Peter Crona**](https://github.com/petercrona): Started the project and have worked hard to keep it nice and tidy. Focusing on the code, but also tried writing some documentation.
